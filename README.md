# Chrome Extension


## Test

Follow these steps to run the extension:
1. Download the repo
2. Go to chrome://extensions in your Google Chrome browser
3. Check the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner
4. Click "Load Unpacked" to see a file-selection dialog
5. Select your extension directory

If your extension is valid, it should load immediately.

If it is invalid, you will see an error message at the top of your page. If this is the case, look for errors, correct them, and try loading your extension again.

The most common errors people make here are syntax errors. Double-check all of your commas and brackets and make sure they are formatted correctly.
